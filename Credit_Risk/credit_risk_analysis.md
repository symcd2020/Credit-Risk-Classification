## Overview of the Analysis

I used techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk using data on historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. There were 77536 rows of data in the set and had fields on loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. I used a logistical regression model to predict if a borrower is creditworthy.

## Results

Machine Learning Model:
    - Accuracy: 0.99
    - Precision: 1.00
    - Recall: 1.00

## Summary

The healthy loan has a 100% accuracy and is therefore very good at predicting. The high-risk loan has an 87% accuracy at predicting. I would recommend trying to improve the accuracy score on the high-risk loans to see if it can get closer to 100%. However, I do still think this is a fine model to use and assist in predicting if a borrower is creditworthy.
